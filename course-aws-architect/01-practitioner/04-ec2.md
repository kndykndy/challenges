# Elastic Compute Cloud, EC2

## Basics

- provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- reduces time to set a new server up to minutes, thus
- allows you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, according to the needs

## Pricing model

### On Demand

You pay fixed rate for an hour/second. No further commitments.

Suitable for:

- when low-cost and flexibility is required without any upfront payment and long term commitment
- apps with short term, spiky, or unpredictable loads that cannot be interrupted
- apps being developed and tested in AWS for the first time

### Reserved

You have capacity reservation. You are offered a significant discount for an hourly usage, depending
on the contract term – 1/3 years

Suitable for:

- apps with steady state and predictable usage
- apps require reserved capacity
- servers paid upfront to reduce total cost

Pricing types:

- standard - offer up to 75% off on EC2 instances; the more you pay upfront the less total price
- convertible - offer up to 54% off on EC2 instances; you can change instance family class as long
  as the created instances are of the same or greater value
- scheduled - available to launch within the time window you choose; e.g. you know that at 9am
  there's a higher traffic from users, so you can scale up in advance using this type

### Spot

You are bidding prices for the instances. If instance price goes above your bid price, you loose an
instance. This option is suitable for applications that have flexible start/end times. If AWS stops
Spot instance you are not paying for the partial hour of usage. If you stop it, you will be charged
for every hour instance was run.

Suitable for:

- apps have flexible start and end times
- apps that are feasible only at very low compute prices
- users with urgent compute needs for large amount of additional capacity (only true if price for
  spot is less than for reserved instance)

### Dedicated host

Physical instances dedicated for your needs. Suitable if you have e.g. server-bound software
licences or obliged to have a dedicated instances because of regulatory issues.

Suitable for:

- for regulatory requirements that do not support multi-tenant virtualization
- licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployment
- can be purchased on-demand, hourly
- can be purchased as a Reservation with up to 70% off the On-demand price

## Instance types

Basic acronym FIGHT DR MCPX Z AU

- F - (F)PGA - for: genomics, fin analytics, big data, real-time video processing
- I - (I)OPS - for: nosql dbs, data warehousing
- G - (G)raphics - for: 3d application streaming, video encoding
- H - (H)igh disk throughput - for: map-reduce, distributed file systems like HDFS
- T - lowest cost general purpose (e.g. (T)2micro) - for: web servers, small dbs
- D - (D)ensity - for: file servers, data warehousing, Hadoop
- R - (R)AM - for: memory-intensive apps/dbs
- M - (M)ain choice for general purpose app servers
- C - (C)ompute - for: CPU-intensive apps/dbs
- P - general purpose G(P)U - for: machine learning, crypto mining
- X - E(X)treme memory - for: SAP HANA, Apache Spark jobs
- Z - Both extreme memory and CPU (Z)oo - for: electronic design automation (EDA) and some db
  workloads
- A - (A)rm-based workloads - for: scale-out workloads for web servers
- U - Bare metal that eliminates the virt(U)alization overhead

## Elastic Block Storage, EBS

EBS provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS
Cloud. After a creation, you attach EBS volume to the EC2 instance. Once attached, you can create a
file system on top of it, run a db or use in any way you would use a block device. EBS volumes are
placed in a specific AZ, where it is automatically replicated to protect you from data loss.

Types:

- SSD
    - General purpose SSD (GP2) – good price/performance ratio for the majority of tasks
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) – the highest performing SSD
- Magnetic
    - Throughput optimised HDD (ST1) – HDD volume designed for throughput-intensive workloads
    - Cold HDD (SC1) – the lowest cost HDD designed for less intense workloads (e.g. file servers)
    - Magnetic HDD – previous generation, obsolete

## HOW-TOs

### How to create an EC2 instance?

- go to Services - Compute - EC2
- hit Launch instance
- Step 1: select Amazon Machine Image (AMI, e.g. Amazon Linux 2 AMI)
- Step 2: choose Instance Type (e.g. t2.micro as it falls in the free tier)
- Step 3: configure Instance Details
    - Purchasing option is a way to request Spot instance, if you want
    - Subnet selection (apart from No preference option) allows you to choose a physical AZ
- Step 4: add Storage
    - you can choose different types for your volumes (default is GP2)
    - Root volume has less volume types to choose from
- Step 5: add Tags – additional info about any AWS resource, here, an EC2 instance
- Step 6: configure Security Group
    - SG is a set of firewall rules that control the traffic of your instance
    - e.g. SSH - TCP - 22 - 0.0.0.0/0 will open TCP based traffic of SSH kind on 22 port for the
      whole world
    - anywhere ipv4 is 0.0.0.0/0, anywhere ipv6 is ::/0
    - add rules for SSH and HTTP
- Step 7: review instance launch, hit Launch
    - first time it will show Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair dialog, choose
      Create a new key pair, give it name, click Download, MyKey.pem file is downloaded, click
      Launch Instance
- go to EC2 list, new instance should have Running state in some time

### How to log in to the EC2 instance for the first time?

- go to Services - Compute - EC2
- choose an instance, Details tab - Instance Summary - pick Public ipv4 address
- chmod 400 MyKey.pem
- ssh ec2-user@# IP # -i MyKey.pem
- sudo su
- yum update -y
