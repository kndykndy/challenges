# Elastic Compute Cloud, EC2

## Basics

- provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- reduces time to set a new server up to minutes, thus
- allows you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, according to the needs

## Pricing model

- On Demand  
  You pay fixed rate for an hour/second. No further commitments.
- Reserved  
  You have capacity reservation. You are offered a significant discount for an hourly usage,
  depending on the contract term – 1/3 years
- Spot  
  You are bidding prices for the instances. If instance price goes above your bid price, you loose
  an instance. This option is suitable for applications that have flexible start/end times. If AWS
  stops Spot instance you are not paying for the partial hour of usage. If you stop it, you will be
  charged for every hour instance was run.
- Dedicated host  
  Physical instances dedicated for your needs. Suitable if you have e.g. server-bound software
  licences or obliged to have a dedicated instances because of regulatory issues.

## Instance types

Basic acronym FIGHT DR MCPX Z AU

- F - (F)PGA

## Elastic Block Storage, EBS

EBS provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS
Cloud.

Types:

- SSD
    - General purpose SSD (GP2) – good price/performance ratio for the majority of tasks
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) – the highest performing SSD
- Magnetic
    - Throughput optimised HDD (ST1) – HDD volume designed for throughput-intensive workloads
    - Cold HDD (SC1) – the lowest cost HDD designed for less intense workloads (e.g. file servers)
    - Magnetic HDD – previous generation, obsolete
